# Music-Store-Analysis-SQL-
In order to learn more about the trends in sales and consumer behavior, we will use SQL to analyze the data from a music store in this project. To find patterns, trends, and anomalies, we will study the sales data, customer data, and product data. In order to improve customer happiness and streamline business operations, the study will assist us in making data-driven decisions.

This project's objective is to evaluate the music store's data to find trends, patterns, and anomalies that may be used to enhance consumer satisfaction and business operations.
